The donkey was walking down the road when it saw a monkey.
The monkey was sitting on a tree and eating a banana.
Suddenly, a huge elephant appeared from the jungle.
The elephant was very friendly and greeted the donkey and monkey.
A tiger was watching them from behind the bushes.
The tiger was the king of the jungle along with the lion.
The lion roared loudly, making all the animals alert.
The donkey, monkey, and elephant quickly ran away.
But the tiger and lion were just playing around.
All the animals lived happily in the forest together.
